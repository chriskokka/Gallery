Gallery


This is a modified version of Zenphoto photo gallery. 
It comes with a custom theme and added feature:
a possibility to send your info: name and email and 
a request about the wish to buy the picture that the
owner of the gallery has put up. Email with your email
address and name with picture info will be sent automatically
from the site to the owner of the gallery.

Zenphoto itself is written in PHP and uses a MySql or MySqli 
database also, with front-end written in HTML/CSS and jQuery.
I have used Twitter Bootstrap for the UI and a jQuery image
gallery for better image display.

I have added only the theme folder that you need to put to your 
zenphoto directory. The php file: functions.php has to be put
under: /zenphoto/zp-core/
